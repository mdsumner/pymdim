# pymdim

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of pymdim is to wrap the osgeo.gdal python package for multidim
raster.

## Installation

You can install the development version of pymdim like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(pymdim)
devtools::load_all()
#> â„¹ Loading pymdim
get_all_array_full_names(multidimraster(sample(eopf_zarr_examples(), 1)))
